	abstract = {Blokus (officially pronounced as “Block us”) is an abstract strategy board game with transparent Tetrisshaped, color pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. However, the players can only place a piece that touches at least one corner of their own pieces on the board. The ultimate goal of the game is to place as many pieces onto the board as a player can while blocking off the opponent’s ability to place more pieces onto the board. Each player has pieces with different shapes and sizes that can be placed onto the board, where each block within a piece counts as one point. The player that scores the highest wins the game.},

	abstract = {Much of recent success in multiagent reinforcement learning has been in two-player zero-sum games. In these games, algorithms such as fictitious self-play and minimax tree search can converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium. While playing a Nash equilibrium strategy in a two-player zero-sum game is optimal, in an \$n\$-player general sum game, it becomes a much less informative solution concept. Despite the lack of a satisfying solution concept, \$n\$-player games form the vast majority of real-world multiagent situations. In this paper we present a new framework for research in reinforcement learning in \$n\$-player games. We hope that by analyzing behavior learned by agents in these environments the community can better understand this important research area and move toward meaningful solution concepts and research directions. The implementation and additional information about this framework can be found at https://colosseumrl.igb.uci.edu/.},
